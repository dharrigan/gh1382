== Instructions

* Add a `gradle.properties` that defines a `nexusUrl` pointing to your repo
** (or change the build.gradle.kts to successfully pull down dependencies)
* Check out my forked `spring-cloud-stream` project and switch to the `GH-1382` branch
* Publish the `spring-cloud-stream` project locally using `./mvnw install -DskipTests -Dgpg.skip`
* Ensure you have kafka running locally
* Fire up this project and try out the `bad-contract-create.sh` and `good-contract-create.sh` scripts
